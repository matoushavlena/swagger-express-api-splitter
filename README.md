#swagger-express-api-splitter

This is an example of a code that allows you to split your long swagger.yaml file into multiple yaml files following the API pattern of your app. For each of the REST API endpoint, you keep 3 files:
* JS implementation - for example `/api/controllers/UsersController.js`
* Swagger model definition - for example `/api/definitions/UsersDefinition.yaml`
* Swagger path description - for example `/api/paths/UsersPath.yaml`

Then we use the gulp script, that watches for changes in these files and automatically compiles the swagger.yaml file which is consumed by SwaggerExpress.

#Dependencies
* swagger-express-mw
* swagger-tools
* gulp

#Demo
* `npm install`
* `gulp`
* `node app.js`

After that, you can open **http://localhost:3000/docs/** and you should see your Swagger documentation.

#Additional info
The swagger.yaml file is automatically generated using gulp. Gulp is watching for changes and compiles the file on fly. Everytime time you do changes in API folder, you need to restart the node.js server. You can use [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) to simplify this process.
